According to theoretical physics, they would need to create a closed timelike curve (CTC) by warping spacetime, potentially through extreme gravitational fields or exotic matter with negative energy density. Key concepts include Einstein's theory of relativity, which shows that time is relative and can be affected by velocity and gravity."}]}

The Colosseum would be in active use for gladiatorial games. You'd hear Latin being spoken, smell incense from temples, and witness the impressive aqueducts delivering fresh water to the city of over 1 million inhabitants."}]}

According to the Novikov self-consistency principle, if time travel to the past is possible, events must be self-consistent - you cannot create a paradox. Other theories suggest multiple timelines (many-worlds interpretation) where changes create alternate realities. Most physicists believe that either the universe prevents paradoxes, or changing the past creates a new timeline branch."}]}

The event represents humanity's achievement and exploration spirit - perfect for a maiden temporal voyage."}]}

Florence, Rome, and Venice around 1500-1550 would offer the richest cultural experiences."}]}
